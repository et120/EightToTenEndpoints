# Mini Challenge Eight To Ten - Endpoints


**Name:** Elizabeth Trotter

**Mini Challenge Scope:** Design an API based on mini challenges from the Combine:
- each endpoint must have their own Controller file, inside a Controller folder
- Also, each one must have their own service file, inside a Service folder
- Data Validation is required.

Endpoints:

1. Magic 8 Ball: create a endpoint generates 8 unique responses

2. Guess It: create 3 endpoints that takes an input, then outputs if the number is higher or lower than the number guessed.
Easy Mode 1-10
Medium Mode 1-50
Hard Mode 1-100

3. Restaurant Picker: create 3 endpoints that takes an input and generates a Randomly Generated Restaurant. Each endpoint will be a different restaurant category that generates a random restaurant based on that category.  10 Restaurants per category.

Code works on postman and swagger. Everything looks good, one thing I had trouble with is figuring out what to input into the box - Such as the restaurant picker I didn't know what to put in until I executed the Endpoint to see the choices. For this fix I would put the choices inside the Routes. Good job!
